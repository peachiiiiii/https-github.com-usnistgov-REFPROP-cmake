Once you have docker installed, and you can do something like:
```
docker run hello-world
```

Copy the FORTRAN files for REFPROP into folder ``RP10src`` in this folder

In this folder, build the image
```
docker built -t rpub18 .
```

Bash into the container
```
docker run -it -v"$(CWD)":/shared  -t rpub18 bash
```

Then inside the container:
```
cd /REFPROP-cmake/build
cmake -DREFPROP_FORTRAN_PATH=/shared/RP10src
cmake --build .
```
